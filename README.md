# Would you find the word in time?

This code is inspired in a game about gessing words called 'ahorcado', here you have the instructions:

- Clone this repositoty in your pc with *python 3* installed and run *main.py*
- A figure and some empty spaces are gonna appear, the hiden word length is equal to the spaces. You should 
enter a letter and figure out what is the hiden word but be careful
- Every time you enter a wrong letter of the word, a part of the 'ahorcado' appears and when it's complete you lose*
-You win if you find the hiden word before the ahorcado appears!
